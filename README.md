Task 3 - Data Science Level 1: 
Here you are required to write the code base necessary to do data analysis and produce a machine learning model to perform topic modelling and sentiment analysis.

You are required to write the following modules at the minimum:

* Data exploration and pre-processing: the codes you fixed at step 1 are the modules you will extend to perform data reading, pre-processing and data exploration and visualisations
* Topic modelling and sentiment analysis: write a code using scikit-learn, Gensim, or other packages and APIs to model the topics discussed in the tweets and their sentiments. You may use word clouds, k-mean clustering, etc. as a simple model for topic modelling.
